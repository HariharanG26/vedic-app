              <h2>Our Mission</h2>
              <p>
                VedicPurohit was founded with the mission to make authentic Vedic rituals accessible to everyone while 
                supporting the community of traditional purohits. In today's fast-paced world, many people find it 
                difficult to connect with qualified priests or understand the significance of these ancient ceremonies.
              </p>
              <p>
                We bridge this gap by providing a platform where you can easily find and book experienced purohits 
                for all types of Vedic rituals, from simple daily pujas to elaborate homams and samskaras.
              </p>
              <p>
                Our purohits are carefully selected based on their knowledge, experience, and dedication to preserving 
                the authenticity of Vedic traditions. Each ceremony is performed according to proper Vedic procedures 
                with attention to every detail.
